## The Apps Description

To help you better understand the application I will answer the following questions:

1. What does the application do?
    
    The application is primarily designed to provide a **debt monitoring system.** 
    
    *What is a debt monitoring system?* In any business setup it is critical to monitor your business' ability to generate money. A debt monitoring system is that extra pair of eyes that helps you broadly look at areas of your business that you most likely miss.

    **Customer Monitoring**

    The application gives you the ability to not only add customers to your account. However, it provides a means of monitoring the following:
    
    1. Customers overall performance in returning debts collected.
    2. Ability to analyze a specific customers statistics so as to best judge their overall impact on your business.

    Knowing the above factors will help one make better decisions when it comes to lending money. Also, having this in place will help you know who needs to be followed up due to non payments.

    **Debt Monitoring**

    The application helps us carefully look at how debts in our company are doing. This feature helps provide quarterly and monthly statistical figures in well plotted charts to help us visualize our business growth.

    This feature is so helpful. Coupled with customer monitoring we are able to track reasons for poor business growth and also follow up on the neccessary actions that need to be taken.

    **Visual Analytics**

    Another important feature is the visual anlytics. This provides us with charts on our customers and debts. The charts used help us make better decisions and analyze business performance quarterly.

2. What technologies have been used and why?

    **Node JS**
    
    I used node js to build the backend of the application. Some of the reasons for choosing it include:
    
    1. Its speed, thanks to the single thread i.e. the event loop which is responsible for all the asynchronous I/O operations.
    2. My level of farmiliarity with it. Also, its ease of use when connecting and interacting with databases.
    
    **Express JS**

    To avoid alot of complexity in building a server, express was the best option for me. Also, its prebuilt middlware's come in handy to avoid unneccessary issues when interacting with the client side. 
    
    **Sequelize**

    To quickly build database tables and run queries super fast, I decided to use this ORM.

    **React JS**

    I used this to realize my frontend. Principaaly the component reuse feature was one of the reasons and also the ease of writing code in it.

    **Locofy**

    I used this to build most of the frontend components as well as work on the responsivesness of the application.

    **MySQL**

    I used this as a means of data persistence.

3. Some challenges I faced?

    **Learning Locofy**
    
    I was working with locofy for the first time. So, I really had struggles figuring out how to work with its tools as their is much documentation on the internet. *Locofy is a tool that helps turn your designs into production-ready frontend code for mobile apps and web.*

    **Building A Fullstack App in 7 Days**

    This was really time consuming. I havent actually had alot of time to test and figure out all the bugs. However, I have the top functionalities I wanted working. Due to the period of time I had I didn't finish all the functionalities I intend the application to have.

4. What are features I plan to add in the future?
    
    **Detailed Customer Monitoring**
    
    Early in this document I stressed that we need to have a detailed examination of customers that we work with. So, in the current version this has not been implemented. In future I want to add a feature that will allow the user to analyze how a single customer is performing in his business.
